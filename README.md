## Choosing the Right Catalog

Selecting the best catalog for your needs depends on several factors:

*   **Environment:** Cloud vs. on-premises, existing tools and infrastructure.
*   **Scale:** The size and growth of your data.
*   **Features:** Version control, auditing, transactionality, ease of integration.
*   **Complexity:** Your desired level of catalog management complexity.

Refer to the detailed descriptions and examples in the respective catalog folders for more information.
