# Iceberg Catalogs: Your Central Hub üßä

Welcome to the Iceberg Catalogs repository! This is your one-stop shop for information about Iceberg catalogs, their features, and how to choose the right one for your data lakehouse.

## Iceberg 

**What is Apache Iceberg?**

Iceberg is an open table format for storing large, analytical datasets. It works seamlessly with poplar engines like Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto,etc.

**Why use Apache Iceberg?**

As organizations grow, their technology stacks and data processing needs evolve. Traditional data pipelines involving data lakes and warehouses often lead to data duplication, quality issues, and expensive maintenance.

Iceberg benefits:

- **Eliminates ETL:** Query data directly without complex data movement and duplication, reducing costs and improving data freshness.
- **Supports Diverse Engines:** Easily use different engines (e.g., Spark, Trino) for varying use cases like analytics or real-time queries, promoting flexibility and efficiency.
- **Cloud and Vendor Agnostic:** Not tied to any specific cloud provider or data warehouse vendor, offering freedom of choice and avoiding lock-in.
- **Reduces Storage Costs:** By eliminating the need for data duplication and optimizing storage formats, Iceberg can significantly reduce storage costs in cloud environments.

In essence, Apache Iceberg simplifies data pipelines, improves efficiency, enhances flexibility, and reduces costs in the ever-changing technology landscape.



## Iceberg catalogs

In the Iceberg ecosystem, catalogs play a crucial role in managing and organizing your tables. They store metadata about your tables, making them discoverable and accessible to query engines and other tools.

## Choosing the Right Catalog

Selecting the best catalog for your needs depends on several factors:

*   **Environment:** Cloud vs. on-premises, existing tools and infrastructure.
*   **Scale:** The size and growth of your data.
*   **Features:** Version control, auditing, transactionality, ease of integration.
*   **Complexity:** Your desired level of catalog management complexity.

Refer to the detailed descriptions and examples in the respective catalog folders for more information.
